\title{Calculate Effective AC Power (High-Pass Filtered)}
\usage{
calc_ac_power(X, fs)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (Time x Channels). The input EEG data trial.}

\item{fs}{Numeric. The sampling frequency in Hz.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the average AC power across all
  channels and time points. Returns 0 if input contains NAs or Infinite values.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean squared power of a signal matrix after removing low-frequency
drifts and DC offsets. This metric is critical for the Closed-Loop SNR calibration
system, ensuring that high-amplitude drifts do not skew the signal-to-noise ratio calculations.
}
\details{
The function applies a 4th-order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 0.1 Hz using forward-backward filtering (\code{filtfilt}) to prevent
phase distortion.
