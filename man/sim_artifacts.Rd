\title{Generate Synthetic Physiological Artifacts (EOG, EMG, Drift)}
\usage{
sim_artifacts(n_time, n_channels, fs, coords_sens)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_time}{Integer. Number of time points to generate.}

\item{n_channels}{Integer. Number of EEG channels.}

\item{fs}{Numeric. Sampling frequency in Hz.}

\item{coords_sens}{Matrix (n_channels x 3). XYZ coordinates of the sensors, used to calculate
spatial projections for EOG and spatial clustering for EMG.}
}
\value{
A list containing two matrices (n_time x n_channels):
\describe{
  \item{\code{N_fast}}{Contains high-frequency artifacts (EOG + EMG).}
  \item{\code{N_drift}}{Contains low-frequency drift artifacts.}
}
}
\description{
Generates a mixture of common EEG artifacts to simulate realistic noise contamination.
This includes ocular artifacts (blinks), muscle artifacts (EMG bursts), and low-frequency
electrode drifts.
}
\details{
The function simulates three distinct types of noise:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{EOG (Eye Blinks):} Modeled as Bell-shaped cosine pulses (Hanning-like) roughly 300ms in duration.
    They occur according to a Poisson process (~15/min) and are projected spatially from a virtual
    frontal source (approximate Fpz location) to the sensors based on distance.
  \item \strong{EMG (Muscle Activity):} Modeled as short bursts (~100ms) of high-frequency noise (>20Hz).
    These are spatially localized to random clusters of 3 neighboring electrodes and occur
    sporadically (Poisson process, ~5/min).
  \item \strong{Drift:} Modeled as a non-stationary random walk (integrated Gaussian noise)
    superimposed with a linear trend. This simulates electrode impedance shifts and DC offsets.
    The drift is normalized to a maximum amplitude of 100 units.
