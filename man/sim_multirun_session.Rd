\title{Simulate a Full Session with Multiple Runs (Cross-Run Drift)}
\usage{
sim_multirun_session(
  n_runs = 3,
  trials_per_run = 20,
  gap_trials = 15,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_runs}{Integer. Number of experimental runs (blocks) to simulate (default: 3).}

\item{trials_per_run}{Integer. Number of trials per run (default: 20).}

\item{gap_trials}{Integer. Number of "virtual" trials to simulate but discard between runs (default: 15).
Higher values create larger distributional shifts between runs.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints run extraction progress.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{sim_eeg_master}} (e.g., \code{n_time}, \code{n_sources}).}
}
\value{
A list formatted similarly to Physionet datasets, containing:
\describe{
  \item{\code{x}}{List of matrices. The EEG data for all valid trials.}
  \item{\code{y}}{Factor. Class labels for all valid trials.}
  \item{\code{run}}{Factor. Run ID for each trial (useful for Leave-One-Run-Out CV).}
  \item{\code{fs}}{Numeric. Sampling frequency.}
  \item{\code{ch_names}}{Character vector. Channel names.}
}
}
\description{
Simulates a complete EEG recording session consisting of multiple experimental "runs"
separated by rest periods. This is critical for validating algorithms that must handle
non-stationarity (drift) across different blocks of time.

\details{
\strong{Drift Injection Strategy:}
To simulate the natural evolution of brain signals and electrode impedance over a long session,
this function generates a single continuous "Giant Simulation" internally. It then:
\enumerate{
  \item Extracts \code{trials_per_run} trials for the active run.
  \item Discards the next \code{gap_trials} trials to simulate the "break" or "rest" period.
    During this gap, the underlying manifold drift (rotation matrix) continues to evolve,
    ensuring that the next run starts with a slightly different distribution than the previous one.
